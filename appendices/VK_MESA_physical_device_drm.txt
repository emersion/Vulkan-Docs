=== Description

This extension provides new facilities to query DRM properties for physical
devices, enabling users to match Vulkan physical devices with DRM nodes on
Linux.

Its functionality closely overlaps with
`EGL_EXT_device_drm`^<<VK_MESA_physical_device_drm-fn1,1>>^.
Unlike the EGL extension, this extension does not expose a string containing
the name of the device file and instead exposes device minor numbers.

DRM defines multiple device node types. Each physical device may have one
primary node and one render node associated. Physical devices may have no
primary node (e.g. if the device doesn't have a display subsystem) or may have
no render node (e.g. if it's a software rendering engine).

To query DRM properties for a physical device, chain
slink:VkPhysicalDeviceDrmPropertiesMESA to slink:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2.
